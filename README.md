# Mint NFT Code Challenge

This repository contains the solution for the SubVisual code challenge. To solve it, I built a dApp for minting NFTs on the Sepolia Testnet. The frontend was developed using React and CSS, while the smart contract was written in Solidity. The smart contract is now deployed on the Sepolia Testnet.

## Technologies

List of technologies used:
- **Solidity** -- Language used for writing smart contracts
- **Foundry** -- Framework used for testing and developing smart contracts
- **Ethers.js** -- Library used for connecting the frontend to the deployed smart contract
- **React.js** -- Framework used to write the frontend
- **Metamask** -- Service that provides Wallet conection

## Requirements

First, you will need a Metamask wallet with the extension installed. If you don’t have one, you can create it for free on their official website.

Minting an NFT on the Sepolia Testnet requires a gas fee paid in Sepolia ETH. To obtain Sepolia ETH for free, you can use any available faucet. I personally recommend using Google Cloud Web3, as it doesn’t require a minimum balance in your wallet.
